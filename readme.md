Some scripts to automate some very oftenly used tasks on Linux

1. Setting up aliases to navigate through various directories
2. Change dir to some other dir, perform some job and come back to previous directory
3. Setting up Ubuntu just in a single command after installation eg. Proxy setup, update, upgrade etc.
4. many more


Which script does what ??

custom_sys_scripts

1.prox_dir.sh 		= an example of changing dir doing some stuff and coming back to current dir
2.usefull_aliases.sh  = Shows a hack on aliases for smooth navigation through different directories
